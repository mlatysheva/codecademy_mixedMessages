This is a [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) Mixed Messages project.
It is a terminal JS application that outputs a randomly chosen inspirational message for students.
The message is assembled out of three parts:
- One sentence about life.
- One sentence about studying.
- One inspirational saying of a famous person.

The 'life' and 'studying' parts are stored in arrays and the 'inspirational saying' part is stored in 
an array of objects with the author and the quote.

I used the git version control system to track the changes and push them to github.

To run the program, you need to have node.js installed and run the following command from the terminal 
from the folder where the file is located:

$ node mixedMessages.js
