This is a [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) Mixed Messages project.
It is a terminal JS application that outputs a randomly chosen inspirational message for students.
The message is assembled out of three parts:
- One sentence about life.
- One sentence about studying.
- One inspirational saying of a famous person.

The 'life' and 'studying' parts are stored in arrays and the 'inspirational saying' part is stored in 
an array of objects with the author and the quote.
